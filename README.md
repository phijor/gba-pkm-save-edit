gba-pkm-save-edit
=================

*A commandline application to edit save files of Pok√©mon-games for the GBA.*

TODO
----

`gba-pkm-save-edit` currently checks the integrity of any save file it is
passed on `stdin`. There's obviously much to do.

1. Cover complete structure of an unpacked save file. Documentation of it can
be found [on
bulbapedia](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Save_data_structure_in_Generation_III).
